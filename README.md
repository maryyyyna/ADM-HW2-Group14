## File description
In the repository  "ADM-HW2-Group14" you'll find `main.ipynb` and `CommandLine.sh`, the result of our efforts.

### 1. `main.ipynb`

#### A Jupyter notebook that contains all our answers and scripts relative to the theoretical questions (from RQ1 to AQ1).

### 2. `CommandLine.sh`

#### A bash shell script file contains the prepared script to answer to the command line question.

## Work flow
We worked principally independently due to the fact we don't live all in Rome and for private commitments (work, study,..). We communicated mainly through Whatsapp-messenger and just in the last days two long meet calls.

We had difficulties given by the dimensions of the dataset, even in AWS, but we found a solution selecting columns of interest according the questions.
Marina was the only component of the group with an important python programming background, Claudiu from Statistics and Jia Economy. Everyone gave his/her best, improving skills, starting from different bases.

## Principal packages used
* Pandas;
* Matplotlib.pyplot;
* Numpy;
* Datetime.
