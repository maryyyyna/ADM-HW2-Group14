In the repository "ADM-HW2-Group14" you'll find "mainDef.ipynb" and "CommandLine.sh", the result of our efforts.

We worked principally independently due to the fact we don't live all in Rome and for private commitments: work, study. We communicated mainly through Whatsapp-messenger and just in the last days two long meet calls.

We had difficulties given by the dimensions of the dataset, even in AWS, but we found a solution selecting columns of interest according the questions.
Marina was the only component of the group with a strong programming background, Claudiu from Statistics and Jia Economy. Everyone gave his/her best, improving skills, starting from different bases.

Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, datetime.

Requests have been divided as follows: RQ1-RQ2-RQ7-RQ8 Claudiu; RQ4-RQ5 Jia;  RQ3-RQ6 Marina; command line Jia; Bonus A Jia,Claudiu,Marina; Bonus B/C Marina; Algorithm Marina.
